# llm-analyst-portfolio
A compact portfolio showcasing LLM evaluation work, prompt design, SQL practice, and BI metric development, with an emphasis on education-focused use cases.
This repository shows how I design, evaluate, and document **LLM prompt experiments** with an educator-first approach.  
It includes synthetic K–12 examples, rubrics, evaluation scripts, and simple analysis to demonstrate model behavior over time.
