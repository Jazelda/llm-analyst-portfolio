# Experiment 03: 8th Grade Science — NGSS MS-PS1-2 Lab Design

This experiment demonstrates my ability to evaluate scientific accuracy, ensure safety, align prompts with NGSS MS-PS1-2, and refine lab activities for middle school feasibility.

---

## V1: Initial Prompt
Create an 8th grade science lab activity about chemical reactions.

---

## Issues Identified (Rubric-Based)

**Safety Risks**  
- LLM sometimes recommends unsafe materials or heat sources.  
- Steps occasionally require equipment not found in middle schools.

**Scientific Accuracy**  
- Some reactions outside typical middle school scope.  
- Advanced vocabulary drift (“stoichiometric ratio,” “endothermic kinetics”).

**Classroom Readiness**  
- Missing pacing notes, data tables, and teacher guidance.

**Standards Alignment**  
- No explicit reference to NGSS MS-PS1-2.

## V2: Improved Prompt
Create an NGSS-aligned 8th grade lab on evidence of chemical reactions.
Include safe materials and safety precautions.

---

## Issues Identified After Evaluating V2

- Lab occasionally too long (>40 minutes).  
- Vocabulary still inconsistent with middle school norms.  
- Teacher notes incomplete or missing misunderstanding patterns.  
- Some reaction choices still too complex.

## V3: Final Prompt (Version Used for Evaluation)
Design a classroom-safe 8th grade science investigation aligned to NGSS MS-PS1-2 (analyze and interpret data on changes to substances to determine if a chemical reaction occurred).

Include:

Purpose: 1–2 sentences describing the focus on evidence of chemical reactions.

Materials: Only middle school–safe items (baking soda, vinegar, yeast, 3% hydrogen peroxide).

Safety Notes: No open flames or heat. Require goggles, table protection, and teacher supervision.

Procedure: 6–8 clear steps written for 8th grade readability.

Data Table: For recording observations (color change, temperature variation, gas production).

Analysis Questions: 3–4 prompts requiring interpretation of observed evidence.

Teacher Notes: Pacing guidance, common misconceptions (e.g., bubbles ≠ boiling), and differentiation options.

Avoid advanced chemical terminology; ensure all components are classroom-safe.

## What This Demonstrates

- Strong safety awareness (critical for education QA)  
- Understanding of NGSS expectations  
- Capacity to refine prompts to avoid unsafe or incorrect outputs  
- Scientific accuracy coupled with age-appropriate vocabulary  
- Structured, reproducible experimental thinking
