# Experiment 02: 7th Grade Math — Ratio Reasoning Word Problems

This experiment demonstrates how I identify mathematical inaccuracies, enforce standards alignment, remove ambiguity, and refine prompts for 7th grade ratio reasoning tasks aligned to CCSS 7.RP.A.2.
---

## V1: Initial Prompt
Write a set of ratio word problems for 7th graders.

---

## Issues Identified (Rubric-Based)

**Accuracy Problems**  
- Some generated problems are unsolvable or contradictory.

**Grade-Level Fit**  
- Problems are often too simple for 7th grade expectations.

**Standards Alignment**  
- No reference to CCSS 7.RP.A.2.

**Classroom Readiness**  
- Missing step-by-step answer keys.  
- Repetitive or unrealistic contexts.

---

## V2: Improved Prompt
Write 5 ratio reasoning word problems aligned to CCSS 7.RP.A.2.
Include an answer key and vary the difficulty levels.

---

## Issues Identified After Evaluating V2

- Excessive use of decimals (not ideal for grade-level, no calculators assumed).  
- Repetitive contexts (all food/sports).  
- Occasional use of high-school–level math terms.

---

## V3: Final Prompt (Version Used for Evaluation)
Create five 7th grade ratio reasoning word problems aligned to CCSS 7.RP.A.2 (Recognize and represent proportional relationships).

Requirements:

Use age-appropriate contexts (school events, clubs, simple travel, supplies).

Include:
• 1 table-based proportional relationship
• 1 multi-step scenario
• 1 problem where students determine whether a relationship is proportional

Prefer whole numbers unless decimals are necessary.

Provide a step-by-step answer key using grade-appropriate mathematical language.

All problems must be solvable without a calculator.

## What This Demonstrates

- Understanding of mathematical standards  
- Ability to catch errors and ambiguous logic  
- Pedagogical alignment with grade-level expectations  
- Strong prompt iteration practices  
- Attention to scaffolding and diversity of problem types
