# Experiment 01: 5th Grade Reading — Main Idea & Supporting Details

This experiment demonstrates how I design, evaluate, and refine prompts for a 5th grade informational text lesson aligned to CCSS RI.5.2, focusing on grade-level fit, clarity, and instructional usefulness.

---

## V1: Initial Prompt
Write a 5th grade reading comprehension activity about “main idea and supporting details.” Include a short passage and ask students questions.

---

## Issues Identified (Rubric-Based)

**Grade-Level Fit**  
- Vocabulary sometimes above a 5th grade reading band.  
- Passage complexity inconsistent.

**Standards Alignment**  
- No explicit anchor to CCSS RI.5.2.

**Classroom Readiness**  
- Missing learning target, structure, clear question design, and checks for understanding.

**Clarity & Structure**  
- Questions sometimes ambiguous or unfocused.

## V2: Improved Prompt
Create a 5th grade reading comprehension activity focused on “Identifying the main idea and supporting details (aligned to CCSS RI.5.2).”
nclude:

A 120–150 word informational passage appropriate for 10–11 year olds.

A clear learning objective written in student-friendly language.

Three comprehension questions targeting the main idea and supporting details.

An answer key.

A short “check for understanding” exit ticket or quick activity.


---

## Issues Identified After Evaluating V2

- Some vocabulary still too advanced (“ecosystem stability,” “biodiversity”).  
- CFU (check for understanding) not always actionable.  
- Answer keys sometimes mirror the passage instead of summarizing.

## V3: Final Prompt (Version Used for Evaluation)


Produce a 5th grade reading lesson aligned to CCSS RI.5.2 (Determine the main idea and explain how it is supported by key details).

Requirements:

Write a 110–130 word informational passage using age-appropriate vocabulary (avoid domain-heavy scientific terms).

Begin with a teacher-facing learning objective.

Provide:
• A student-friendly learning target
• 3 questions (1 main idea, 2 supporting detail)
• An answer key written in complete sentences
• A 2-minute “Check for Understanding” (exit ticket or pair-share)

Tone must be instructional, clear, and classroom-ready.
