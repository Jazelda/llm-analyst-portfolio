# SQL Playground

This repository contains a collection of intermediate-level SQL patterns that demonstrate my proficiency with analytical SQL.  
The examples are intentionally small and focused on commonly required transformations used in analytics, reporting, QA workflows, and model evaluation pipelines.

All queries use **synthetic** sample schemas and can be adapted to Snowflake, Postgres, BigQuery, or similar SQL engines.

## ✅ How to Use This Repository

These queries are meant as:
- standalone SQL patterns  
- a demonstration of analytical fluency  
- a reference set for interviews or technical assessments  
- templates for real-world reporting or evaluation work  

Each file is fully copyable and runnable with a simple synthetic dataset.
